Information security means protecting information and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.

Information assurance is tightly coupled with many aspects of business management including information technology infrastructure library 

Asset: Anything that has value to an organisation 
	If it has value to you, it has value to them
Information security protects:
	People
	Processes
	Reputation
	Buildings
	Information
	Hardware and software

There are many different assets such as:
	Information:
		Stored on paper i.e contracts, manuals and electronically i.e hdds, usb, video, phones, databases
	Software:
		Programs, operating systems, applications, dev tools
	Services:
		Service that the computer systems depend upon such as heating, cooling, power, lighting etc
	People:
		Employees, owners, managers who carry all the skills and information regarding how the company operates 
	Intangibles:
		Reputation and image
Examples are 
	Secret plans for a new product
	Reputation of the company in providing a highly available communication service


Principles of information security

Confidentiality:
	Non-disclosure, access on a need to know basis, least privilege. 
	It ensures that information is not disclosed to unauthorised people or processes.
	Requirement information is protected to prevent intentional or unintentional unauthorised disclosure i.e disgruntled employee
> Refers to limits on who can get what kind of information. i.e protecting secrets and personal data. 

Integrity:
- Protects the accuracy and completeness of assets. 
- Information is only useful if it is complete and accurate. 
- Modifications are not made to data by unauthorised personnel or processes
- Unauthorised mods are not made to the data even by authorised personnel or processes
- Data is internally and externally consistent. 

Availability:
	Reliable and timeless access to data or IT resources by appropriate people. 
	Guarantees systems are up and running when they are needed. 
	Hardware maintenance, software patching/upgrading and network optimisation ensures availability

Non Repudiation 
+ Holds individuals to account by knowing who did what and when they did it. 
	+ Proving someone sent an email
	+ Proving an online transaction took place
	+ Refers to the presentation of evidence that cannot be forged whereby the message can be proven as being sent or received. 
	+ If something is disputed, then important identity actions can be challenged or jeopardised. When this occurs, proof is determined by a 3rd party where neither the sender or receiver can dispute the action.
> The ability to prove the occurrence of a claimed event or action and its originating entities
> Proving someone actually sent the email to their employer/manager.
> Proving someone performed a transaction i.e ordering from the internet. 

# Getting the balance right 
 > Resources are limited
 > Confidentiality, integrity, availability are often in conflict.

Confidentiality is more important when the value of information depends on limiting access to it i.e way more important than integrity and availability in the case of trade secrets. Confidentiality is most important when the information is a record of peoples personal data. 

Integrity is more important in financial information. Changes in finance records can lead to issues in accuracy, consistency and value of the information. I.e banks are more concerned about integrity of financial records with confidentiality being 2nd priority. Some people leave receipts at the ATM. This shows how confidentiality is typically 2nd even if the receipt says data i.e name and amount deposited/withdrawn. 

# Defence in Depth & Breadth

## Defence in depth
There are layers of security that build on one another. It is impossible to protect all information assets to the highest degrees possible cos it costs too much gwap. Also because some information assets need to be freely available to staff in order for them to do their job. Other information is more critical and sensitive so they get priority for protection. 

## Defence in breadth
Coined phrase that came due to all the connections to any networked system. Networks these days are getting super complex and difficult to manage. 

This concept of understanding the breadth of the network is critical --> at its weakest link it will break. 

In a complex network, a criminal will try to break in via the lowest level of security point. Malware can travel through a network, finding holes or legitimate services can make the intruder seem as a trusted user. 

Defence in depth and breath is a strategy to leverage security to provide redundancy, to buy time to detect and enact a response and to span the wide reaching end points and variety of security systems to provide a timely synchronised response.
